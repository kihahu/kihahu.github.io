**Why Keep One?**

A personal blog/site is one thing that would help you guys show case your experience and some of the interesting things you have been working on, whether a student or employed. Personal projects help you learn beyond your current scope i.e student or employee and might in the future turn out to be your main job, that has been my experience. 

**My Experience**

I started out doing web development, but was interested in Linux system administration / information security and kept learning this topics on the side and kept a blog of my learnings. This led me to get a role as a sys-admin in the next company I worked for.

So I challenge young guys starting out on their career to create and maintain a blog of what you are currently studying, experimenting with. This can actually be something you list as a project you worked on adding things like a CI pipeline to automate publishing.
